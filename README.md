# natural_selection-

There are multiple parameter that can be modified to get different simulations.

Energy (in the indiv class)-> The more energy the longer the black dots can survive withtout eating 
//T_m (in the process function) -> Set the duration of the simulation for a given generation
//Speed (in the init_pop function as one of the paramters for the new dots) -> Slower dots need a greater time span to survive
//Number of food dots (in the plateau class as number) -> sets the number of green dots (renewed each generation)


To run the program, use procees(x,y,z) where x is the size of the box (usually 15 to 20), y is the number of black dots (usually 20) 
and z is the number of generation (usually around 10)
